            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
                Season steak with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Working in batches,
                add steak to the stockpot and cook, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 6-8 minutes;
                set aside.</li>
            <li>Add onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and mushrooms, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and browned, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk in flour and tomato paste until lightly browned, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the stockpot.</li>
            <li>Stir in beef stock, thyme, bay leaves and steak. Bring to a boil;
                reduce heat and simmer until beef is very tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in potato; simmer until potatoes are just tender and stew has thickened, about 20 minutes.
                Remove and discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Stir in parsley; season with salt and pepper, to taste.*</li>
